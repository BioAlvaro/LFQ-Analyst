# LFQ_analysis_pipeline
Repository for quantitative proteomics data analysis pipeline

## Question to address
- Automate downstream statistical analysis of Label free quantitative proteomics data (generated by MaxQuant)
- Creat a Shiny app for Monash Biomedical Proteomcis Facility (MBPF) for facilitate data analysis

### Input
- MaxQuant proteinGroups.txt file
- An experiment design table (tab separated file) containing three columns ("label", "condition", "replicate")

#### Data pre-filtering criteria
- Remove potential contaminants
- Remove reverse sequences
- Remove proteins identified only by sites
- Remove proteins identified/quantified by a single Razor or unique peptide
- Remove observation with high proportion of missing values (intensity values must be present
at least 2 out of three replicates)

#### Advanced parameters to choose
- Types of imputation 
  - Perseus like ( Drawing random numbers based on distribution of sample)
  - Knn based imputation
  - bpca based imputation
  - QRILC
  - MLE
  - MinDet
  - MinProb
  - min
  - zero (convert all NA values to zero)
- Differencial expression cutoff
  - Adjusted p-value cutoff (FDR cutoff on quantitation)
  - Log2 fold change cutoff 
  
### Output
- Tables (csv format)
  1. Differential expression analysis results
  2. Input data matrix
  3. Imputed data matrix
  4. Full results (with and without imputation coulumns along with fold change and p-values)
- Result Plots
  1. PCA plot (Could move to QC section)
  2. Heatmap for differencially expressed proteins 
  3. Volcano plot for each pairwise comparison
- QC plots
  1. Sample Correlation (pearson correlation)
  2. Sample Coefficient of variations (CVs)
  3. Numeber of proteins per sample
  4. Sample coverage (overlap of identified proteins across every sample)
  5. Missing value heatmap
  6. Imputation effect on sample distribution

### Done So Far
- R scipt for differencial expression analysis of LFQ data
- Shiny app (development version)

### To Do
- Run it on Shiny server with R version 3.4.1
- Build a download button for downloading all plots
